# Data Visualization and Communication: Assignment 4 #
This was the fourth assignment of my Data Visualization class as part of my Data Analytics coursework. We were tasked by taking three datasets and using R visualizations to determine where to put up new beauty stores. Unfortunately we weren't given a lot of direction on this assignment and the data was not fitting for making these decisions.

However, this was my first time using RMarkdown and Shiny and I am really proud of the output I created. I have reactive visualizations and a video in my output.

Here if a gif showing a quick overview of the final product:
